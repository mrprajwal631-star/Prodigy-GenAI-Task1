# Prodigy InfoTech Generative AI Internship - Task 1

## Task Name
Text Generation using GPT-2

## Objective
Train or use a GPT-2 model to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given prompt.

## Description
In this project, GPT-2 (a transformer-based language model developed by OpenAI) is used to generate text based on user input. 
The model predicts the next words in a sequence to produce meaningful and human-like text output.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- HuggingFace Transformers
- GPT-2 Model
- PyTorch

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries:
   pip install transformers torch

2. Run the Python file:
